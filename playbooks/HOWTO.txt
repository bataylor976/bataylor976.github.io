Comment out multiple lines in vim:

To comment out blocks in vim:

    1. press Esc (to leave editing or other mode)
    2. hit ctrl + v (visual block mode)
    3. use the up/down arrow keys to select lines you want (it won't highlight everything - it's OK!)
    4. Shift + i (capital I)
    5. insert the text you want, i.e. '% '
    6. press Esc.

Copy the file "foobar.txt" from a remote host to the local host

    $ scp your_username@remotehost.edu:foobar.txt /some/local/directory

scp multiple files from remote host to a local directory

scp console@jaguar:/home/console/\{lxc-cscript2.c.orig,lxc-cscript2.c,lxc-cscript2.7} .

Edit your .bashrc (append to last line) or prepend the Anaconda2 install location:

$ export PATH=/home/pupi/anaconda2/bin:$PATH

Thank you for installing Anaconda2!

Targets: When the defined pattern matches, the action that takes place is called a target. A target can be a final policy decision for the packet, such as accept, or drop. It can also be move the packet to a different chain for processing, or simply log the encounter. There are many options.

These rules are organized into groups called chains. A chain is a set of rules that a packet is checked against sequentially. When the packet matches one of the rules, it executes the associated action and is not checked against the remaining rules in the chain.

A user can create chains as needed. There are three chains defined by default. They are:

    INPUT: This chain handles all packets that are addressed to your server.
    OUTPUT: This chain contains rules for traffic created by your server.
    FORWARD: This chain is used to deal with traffic destined for other servers that are not created on your server. This chain is basically a way to configure your server to route requests to other machines.

'du' - Finding the size of a directory

$ du
Typing the above at the prompt gives you a list of directories that exist in the current directory along with their sizes. The last line of the output gives you the total size of the current directory including its subdirectories. The size given includes the sizes of the files and the directories that exist in the current directory as well as all of its subdirectories. Note that by default the sizes given are in kilobytes.


$ du /home/david
The above command would give you the directory size of the directory /home/david


$ du -h
This command gives you a better output than the default one. The option '-h' stands for human readable format. So the sizes of the files / directories are this time suffixed with a 'k' if its kilobytes and 'M' if its Megabytes and 'G' if its Gigabytes.


$ du -ah
This command would display in its output, not only the directories but also all the files that are present in the current directory. Note that 'du' always counts all files and directories while giving the final size in the last line. But the '-a' displays the filenames along with the directory names in the output. '-h' is once again human readable format.


$ du -c
This gives you a grand total as the last line of the output. So if your directory occupies 30MB the last 2 lines of the output would be

30M .
30M total

The first line would be the default last line of the 'du' output indicating the total size of the directory and another line displaying the same size, followed by the string 'total'. This is helpful in case you this command along with the grep command to only display the final total size of a directory as shown below.


$ du -ch | grep total
This would have only one line in its output that displays the total size of the current directory including all the subdirectories.

Note : In case you are not familiar with pipes (which makes the above command possible) refer to Article No. 24 . Also grep is one of the most important commands in Unix. Refer to Article No. 25 to know more about grep.


$ du -s
This displays a summary of the directory size. It is the simplest way to know the total size of the current directory.


$ du -S
This would display the size of the current directory excluding the size of the subdirectories that exist within that directory. So it basically shows you the total size of all the files that exist in the current directory.


$ du --exculde=mp3
The above command would display the size of the current directory along with all its subdirectories, but it would exclude all the files having the given pattern present in their filenames. Thus in the above case if there happens to be any mp3 files within the current directory or any of its subdirectories, their size would not be included while calculating the total directory size.

# Copy and Paste in Vim

#Here is how to cut-and-paste or copy-and-paste text using a visual selection 
#in Vim.

#Cut and paste:

    Position the cursor where you want to begin cutting.
    Press v to select characters (or uppercase V to select whole lines).
    Move the cursor to the end of what you want to cut.
    Press d to cut (or y to copy).
    Move to where you would like to paste.
    Press P to paste before the cursor, or p to paste after. 

Copy and paste is performed with the same steps except for step 4 where you would press y instead of d:

    d = delete = cut
    y = yank = copy
